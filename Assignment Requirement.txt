together towards this group assignment.
If detected, all parties involved w ll get 0 marks.
The codes must be your own.


In this assignment, you are required to implement a "Light Mariadb Interpreter" using The interpreter interprets the file input statements.
Implementations
standard C++.
- Readingrfromt a file, outputting to screen, writing to a file
The requi ements of the light interpreter are:
- Create one da abase and view one database name
- Create one table and view one table name

- Table supports two data types i.e. INT, TEXT, maximum of ten columns
- Insert rows to the table
- View table in csv mode


- Update table rows and view table
- Delete table rows and view table

- Count and output number of rows in the table

table of contents,lpage numbering, inputs, outputs, screenshots,l explanations, and others., The given requirements in the sample inputs and sample outputs below are the basic
Also document a l your assignment tasks with the marking tab e that contain cover page
requirements of this assignment.
You may feel free to add more features and capabilities to make the interpreter robust and
efficient.
